# FNF' Destroyer

This mod began development way back in August 2021. The first thing which was created by me was a background for Dark's area. "Hallway 1" was the thing which started this mod to begin with, so I added my OCs into the mod. Right now, it's currently planned to be released in 2023. (Will update before the mod officially releases in 2023.)

## Engine
Of course, the engine is ShadowMario's "Pysch Engine". Here is the link: https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine. The engine for "FNF' Destroyer" may or may not be changed in the future, although Pysch is the current engine planned for the mod. 

## Release Date
I am hoping to officially release the full mod in 2023, although I'm not sure about when I may be releasing the demo. The demo will probably release between 2022 - 2023. I would estimate the full mod to be releasing from mid 2023 - late 2023, although it might take slightly longer.
