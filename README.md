# FNF' Destroyer

This mod began development way back in August 2021. The first thing which was created by me was a background for Dark's area. "Hallway 1" was the thing which started this mod to begin with, so I added my OCs into the mod. It was planned to be released in 2024. (The mod would eventually be cancelled on March 18, 2024, and eventually would be continued.)

## Engine
Of course, the engine is ShadowMario's "Pysch Engine". Here is the link: https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine. The engine for "FNF' Destroyer" was planned to not be changed, although the build went in and out of Psych engine. 

## Release Date
The mod is cancelled, but was planned to be released in 2024. The demo was also planned to be released in 2024. The mod would later be cancelled on March 18, 2024. Update: I am currently working on the demo yet again. Made good progress on the art and songs.
